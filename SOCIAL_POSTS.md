### Option A: Problem-focused (recommended)

```
Lost 30 minutes yesterday trying to remember where I left off after a crash.

Built a /recover command for Claude Code that:
- Lists recent sessions across all projects
- Finds your session docs automatically
- Checks which services were running
- Generates a handoff prompt to continue

Open source: github.com/exodoc-ftl/claude-recover
```

### Option B: Shorter, punchier

```
Session continuity for Claude Code.

/recover → see all recent sessions
"recover session 2" → Claude reads your docs, checks services, picks up where you left off

Built this after one too many crashes. Maybe useful to others.

```

### Option C: Demo-focused

```
One command to recover any Claude Code session:

/recover

Shows recent sessions, detects your docs, checks if services are running.

Say "recover 2" and you're back to work with full context.

### Option A: Context + utility

```
If you're using Claude Code for multiple projects, you've probably experienced this:

Machine crashes. You restart. Now you're trying to remember which project you were working on, what services were running, and where exactly you left off.

I built a small tool to fix this.

/recover lists your recent sessions across all projects, finds session documentation automatically, and checks service status. Tell it which session to recover and it generates a complete handoff prompt to continue exactly where you stopped.

It's part of a session-based development workflow where each coding session is self-contained with its own documentation—making recovery trivial.

### Option B: Shorter

```
Built a session recovery tool for Claude Code after losing context one too many times.

One command shows recent sessions across all projects, detects your docs, checks which services were running. Pick a session and it generates a handoff prompt with full context.

Simple utility, but saves real time when you're juggling multiple projects with background services.
